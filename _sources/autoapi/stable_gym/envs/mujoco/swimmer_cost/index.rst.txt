.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   Modified version of the swimmer Mujoco environment found in the
   :gymnasium:`gymnasium library <environments/mujoco/swimmer>`. This modification was
   first described by `Han et al. 2020`_. In this modified version:

   -   The objective was changed to a velocity-tracking task. To do this, the reward is replaced with a cost.
       This cost is the squared difference between the swimmer's forward velocity and a reference value (error).
   -   Three **optional** variables were added to the observation space; The reference velocity, the reference error
       (i.e. the difference between the swimmer's forward velocity and the reference) and the swimmer's forward velocity.
       These variables can be enabled using the ``exclude_reference_from_observation``,
       ``exclude_reference_error_from_observation`` and ``exclude_velocity_from_observation`` environment arguments.

   Source:
       This is a modified version of the swimmer Mujoco environment found in the
       :gymnasium:`gymnasium library <environments/mujoco/swimmer>`. This modification was
       first described by `Han et al. 2020 <https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.14288>`_. Compared
       to the original Swimmer environment in this modified version:

       -   The objective was changed to a velocity-tracking task. To do this, the reward
           is replaced with a cost. This cost is the squared difference between the
           swimmer's forward velocity and a reference value (error). Additionally, also
           a control cost can be included in the cost.
       -   Three **optional** variables were added to the observation space; The reference velocity, the reference error
           (i.e. the difference between the swimmer's forward velocity and the reference) and the swimmer's forward velocity.
           These variables can be enabled using the ``exclude_reference_from_observation``,
           ``exclude_reference_error_from_observation`` and ``exclude_velocity_from_observation`` environment arguments.

       The rest of the environment is the same as the original Swimmer environment.
       Below, the modified cost is described. For more information about the environment
       (e.g. observation space, action space, episode termination, etc.), please refer
       to the :gymnasium:`gymnasium library <environments/mujoco/swimmer>`.

   Modified cost:
       A cost, computed using the :meth:`SwimmerCost.cost` method, is given for each
       simulation step, including the terminal step. This cost is defined as the error
       between the Swimmer's forward velocity and a reference value. A control
       cost can also be included in the cost. The cost is computed as:

       .. math::

           cost = w_{forward\_velocity} \times (x_{velocity} - x_{reference\_x\_velocity})^2 + w_{ctrl} \times c_{ctrl}

   Solved Requirements:
       Considered solved when the average cost is less than or equal to 50 over
       100 consecutive trials.
