   Custom Humanoid gymnasium environment.

   .. note::
       Can also be used in a vectorized manner. See the
       :gymnasium:`gym.vector <api/vector>` documentation.

   Source:
       This is a modified version of the Humanoid Mujoco environment found in the
       :gymnasium:`gymnasium library <environments/mujoco/humanoid>`. This modification
       was first described by `Han et al. 2020 <https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.14288>`_.
       Compared to the original Humanoid environment in this modified version:

       -   The objective was changed to a velocity-tracking task. To do this, the reward
           is replaced with a cost. This cost is the squared difference between the
           Humanoid's forward velocity and a reference value (error). Additionally, also
           a control cost and health penalty can be included in the cost.
       -   Three **optional** variables were added to the observation space; The reference velocity, the reference error
           (i.e. the difference between the humanoid's forward velocity and the reference) and the humanoid's forward velocity.
           These variables can be enabled using the ``exclude_reference_from_observation``,
           ``exclude_reference_error_from_observation`` and ``exclude_velocity_from_observation`` environment arguments.

       The rest of the environment is the same as the original Humanoid environment.
       Below, the modified cost is described. For more information about the environment
       (e.g. observation space, action space, episode termination, etc.), please refer
       to the :gymnasium:`gymnasium library <environments/mujoco/humanoid>`.

   Modified cost:
       A cost, computed using the :meth:`HumanoidCost.cost` method, is given for each
       simulation step, including the terminal step. This cost is defined as the error
       between the Humanoid's forward velocity and a reference value. A control
       cost and health penalty can also be included in the cost. The cost is computed as:

       .. math::

           cost = w_{forward\_velocity} \times (x_{velocity} - x_{reference\_x\_velocity})^2 + w_{ctrl} \times c_{ctrl} + p_{health}

   Solved Requirements:
       Considered solved when the average cost is less than or equal to 50 over
       100 consecutive trials.

                                                      the position can serve as an inductive bias to induce position-agnostic
