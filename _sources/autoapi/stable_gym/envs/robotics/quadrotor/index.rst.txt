       Modified version of the `QuadXHover environment`_ found in the
       :PyFlyt:`PyFlyt package <>`. This environment was first described by `Tai et al. 2023`_.
       In this modified version:

       -   The reward has been changed to a cost. This was done by negating the reward always
           to be positive definite.
       -   A health penalty has been added. This penalty is applied when the quadrotor moves
           outside the flight dome or crashes. The penalty equals the maximum episode steps
           minus the steps taken or a user-defined penalty.
       -   The ``max_duration_seconds`` has been removed. Instead, the ``max_episode_steps``
           parameter of the :class:`gym.wrappers.TimeLimit` wrapper is used to limit
           the episode duration.

       The rest of the environment is the same as the original QuadXHover environment.
       Please refer to the `original codebase <https://github.com/jjshoots/PyFlyt>`__,

       `article of Tai et al. 2023`_ for more information.

   Modified cost:
       A cost, computed using the :meth:`QuadXHoverCost.cost` method, is given for each
       simulation step, including the terminal step. This cost is defined as the
       Euclidean distance error between the quadrotors' current position and a desired
       hover position (i.e. :math:`p=x_{x,y,z}=[0,0,1]`) and the error between the
       quadrotors' current angular roll and pitch and their zero values. A health penalty
       can also be included in the cost. This health penalty is added when the drone
       leaves the flight dome or crashes. It equals the ``max_episode_steps`` minus the
       number of steps taken in the episode or a fixed value. The cost is computed as:

       .. math::

           cost = \| p_{drone} - p_{hover} \| + \| \theta_{roll,pitch} \| + p_{health}

   Solved Requirements:
       Considered solved when the average cost is less than or equal to 50 over
       100 consecutive trials.

   Modified cost:
       A cost, computed using the :meth:`QuadXWaypointsCost.cost` method, is given for each
       simulation step, including the terminal step. This cost is defined as the Euclidean
       error between the quadrotors' current position and the position of the current
       waypoint (i.e. :math:`p=x_{x,y,z}=[0,0,1]`). Additionally, a penalty is
       given for moving away from the waypoint, and a health penalty can also
       be included in the cost. This health penalty is added when the drone leaves the
       flight dome or crashes. It equals the ``max_episode_steps`` minus the
       number of steps taken in the episode or a fixed value. The cost is
       computed as:

       .. math::

           cost = 10 \times \| p_{drone} - p_{waypoint} \| - \min(3.0 \times (p_{old} - p_{drone}), 0.0) + p_{health}

   Solved Requirements:
       Considered solved when the average cost is less than or equal to 50 over
       100 consecutive trials.
